# Hardware Image Filter

This project includes a hardware RTL design of median filter. The intention of the project was to be able to run on FPGA, but since I have not access to FPGA, results would be generated by RTL testbench. 

## Design 

Median filter, as the name suggested, would found the median value of a sequence of numbers. The input of the median filter is a 3x3 window of 9 pixels. The implementation of the median filter utilize partial sort. a median value of three sets of three pixels would be generated first, then the median amount the previously computed medians would be found as the final result. 

The median filter consist two different module: register and comparator. The register would pass the input value to the output on posedge of clock when the enable signal is on high. The comparator would accept two inputs operand and find a max value and a min value. The two module is integrated into the top level filte called median_filter.v where wires are declared and connect all registers and comparators. 

The filter would accept input pixels in serial manner, and the entire design is pipelined with 7 stages. The first two stage is controlled by enable 1, the rest of the stages is controlled by enable 2. The enable 2 would turn on high when enable 1 was on high twice. Stage1 and Stage2 was used to load first two pixels
